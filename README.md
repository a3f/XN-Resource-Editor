## XN Resource Editor

XN Resource Editor is a free, powerful, fully featured
resource editor and PE module explorer for
Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

This here is a mirror for the source code of version 3.0.0.1 released 17th December 2005.&nbsp; Rights reserved to the original author, ![Colin Wilson](http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/). 
Please see the
[read
me](files/d10/xnresourceeditor/readme.txt) file
for details of what was new in that release.
&nbsp;

This is the latest version of the popular Resource Editor -
brought up to date with XP Manifest, Accelerator table and .RC file support.

XNResourceEditor works with all resource files (.RES) and PE
modules (.EXE, .DLL, etc.) but it has special knowledge of modules written in
Delphi.&nbsp; It can display all the modules that comprise a Delphi program, and
let you edit the properties of the components used on Delphi forms.

And unusually XNResourceEditor can modify PE modules - even if
you use Windows 98!

To compile XNResourceEditor you'll need to install the
Resource Editor Components package that comes with the source download, together with my
[Miscellaneous
Components](d9miscunits.htm) package&nbsp; (make sure you've got the latest version).&nbsp;
You'll also need my [Resource Utilities](d9resourceutils.htm), [Low
Level Utilities](d9lowlevel.htm) and [Image Types](d9graphicsutils.htm)  packages.
