## XN Resource Editor

XN Resource Editor is a free, powerful, fully featured resource editor and PE module explorer for Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

This here is a mirror for the source code of version 3.0.0.1, released 17th December 2005. Rights reserved to the original author, ![Colin Wilson](http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/). 
Please see the [changelog](changelog.md) file for details of what was new in that release.

This is the latest version of the popular Resource Editor - brought up to date with XP Manifest, Accelerator table and .RC file support.

XNResourceEditor works with all resource files (.RES) and PE modules (.EXE, .DLL, etc.) but it has special knowledge of modules written in Delphi. It can display all the modules that comprise a Delphi program, and let you edit the properties of the components used on Delphi forms.

And unusually XNResourceEditor can modify PE modules - even if you use Windows 98!

To compile XNResourceEditor you'll need to install the Resource Editor Components package that comes with the source download, together with my [Miscellaneous Components](http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d9miscunits.htm) package (make sure you've got the latest version). You'll also need my [Resource Utilities](www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d9resourceutils.htm), [Low Level Utilities](www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d9lowlevel.htm) and [Image Types](www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/d9graphicsutils.htm) packages.
